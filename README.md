AST2 UUT Test Looper

INCOMPLETE PROJECT, NOT FUNCTIONAL AT ALL

When completed, this project will add some much-needed features that AST2 is missing from AST1. The goal is to:
- Allow tests to iterated over a given number of times, or indefinitely, or until a certain condition is met (Time, failure, other?)
- Allow user to specify which non-interactive tests to iterate over (Single test, selected tests, only EFI, only OS, All)
- Allow user to do this for multiple UUT's concurrently
